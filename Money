We are more powerful than money



Like it or not, we need money to live and survive. Unfortunately, not all of us are born with the opportunity. The opportunity to be able to afford education. Base on my perspective, education is the most important thing that a person deserves to have. To be able to afford education, some people have to work three jobs to provide for their children’s needs. They must do a lot of sacrifices such as leave their children to move to another place to work or maybe make their children work as well and that is heartbreaking.

Education is the most powerful asset that we can have. No matter what happen, our brain will make us survive. So, if you are born with the opportunity to afford education, don’t waste it.

Based on Max Duncan’s “Down from the Mountains”, a twelve year old girl named Wang Bing said, “As long as I study hard, I can achieve my dreams. If you don’t study, your life will be a struggle.”

You don’t need to have a lot of money, as long as you eat three times a day, you are able to afford your needs, and you have the determination to achieve your dream, that’s fine, you’ll make it.
