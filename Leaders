We Are All Leaders



According to Forbes – “Leadership is a process of social influence, which maximizes the efforts of others, towards the achievement of a goal”. From home, school, organizations, cities, to countries, there are what we called “Leaders”. These people are the one’s who we consider as role models. When we start schooling until the end, we are trained to be a leader. But I guess we still don’t get the definition of a Leader or Leadership.

When you are assigned on a group, there will be a leader and there will be members. The role of the members is to follow their leader. It is your responsibility to follow your leader. But are you sure that your leader is doing the right thing or are you just following? Leadership is not only about power.

We live in a century where we base our choices and decisions on other people’s success. We can’t make our own decision. A decision that is based on our character and perspective. Even though the leader you follow choose this and that, you don’t have to follow them. Be your own leader.

You have a different purpose, you are unique, and your perspective can impact others. A true leader is not the most intelligent, educated, rich, and successful person in the world. A true leader is the person who wants to make a difference in the world and an impact to other people. The person who help others achieve their dreams and do the right thing. That is what you can call a “Leader”.
